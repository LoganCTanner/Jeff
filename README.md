# Jeff
Jeff is a non-linear dynamical psychic driving assistant.

Jeff has two primary goals
1. Assisting in the prevention of negative psychological states
2. Advocating positive psychological growth

## The path forward
The two primary technologies comprising Jeff are Non=Linear Dynamics & Psychic Driving.

### Non-Linear Dynamics
- The core principles being attractors, repulsors, and hybrid attractor-repulsors, which I will refer to as "nodes"
- In this usage, the negative psychic states would be repulsors, and positive being attractors
- The complexity lies in the distancing between nodes and classification of potential hybrid attractor-repulsors given personal circumstances

### Psychic Driving
- Psychic Driving is the process of using verbal, physical, and cognitive actions to change behavior
- Logical process of Psychic Driving implemented through biases 
- Biases obtained through global & user standards
- Global standards utilizes prior defined positive states 

## Bringing it together
At the end of the day Jeff is meant to support users through day to day journaling
