# Jeff
Jeff is a non-linear dynamical psychic driving assistant.

Jeff has two primary goals
1. Assisting in the prevention of negative psychological states
2. Advocating positive psychological growth

## The path forward
The two primary technologies comprising Jeff are Non=Linear Dynamics & Psychic Driving.

### Non-Linear Dynamics
- The core principles being attractors, repulsors, and hybrid attractor-repulsors, all of which I will refer to as "nodes"
- In Jeff's usage, the negative psychic states would be repulsors, and positive being attractors
- The complexity lies in the distancing between nodes and classifying higher dimensional nodes from the user's form entries

### Psychic Driving
- Psychic Driving is the process of using verbal, physical, and cognitive actions to change behavior
- Logical process of Psychic Driving implemented through biases 
- Biases obtained through global & user standards
- Global standards utilizes prior defined positive states 

## Bringing it together
At the end of the day Jeff is meant to support users through day to day journaling. If Jeff suspects a negative state is imminent, or could be imminent, it will warn the user against a given course of action & the reasons why it warned them. If Jeff suspects a positive state could be obtainable through a healthy means it will advise the user on the more positive trajectory.

## How does Jeff work under the hood?
Great question, I have no idea. Jeff is a long term goal as I continue my education & meet the pre requisites to build Jeff. My current hope is that Jeff can be more easily implemented by biasing large language models, but there is still a large amount to do in terms of labeling & weighting nodes, as well as building out the front & back end infrastructure.
